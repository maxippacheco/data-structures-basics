We have some real-world examples that can be exemplified as a linked list. The first
example is a conga line. Each person is an element, and the hands would be the pointer that
links to the next person in the conga line. You can add people to the lineâ€”you just need to
find the spot where you want to add this person, decouple the connection, then insert the
new person and make the connection again.
